# jfortune

`fortune` is a program from the early days of UNIX that produces fortune cookies.
The first version appears 1979 in [Unix Version 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_7_Unix).
`jfortune` is a rewrite of the program in Java which can be defined as dependency for your own Java application.

The first version of `jfortune` was written in 2003 with Java 1.4, JUnit 3 and [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/).
It is now digged out, put on GitHub and will be delivered to the Central Maven Repo ([OSSRH-36625](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-36625)).
Later it will be reworked, adapted to Java 8 and new features will be added.
